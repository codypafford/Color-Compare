Simply run the Python script and then select an image. After selecting an image, choose your base color by left-clicking anywhere in your chosen photo. 
Next, you will be able to left-click any other part of the photo to compare the base color and that color. 
Each comparison will provide you with the % of difference and similarity between the two colors.
