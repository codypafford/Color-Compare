This was a simple app made to check the paramters in your fish tank by comparing the colors of the aquarium test kit vials with the color chart.

Simply run the Python script and then select an image. After selecting an image, choose your base color by left-clicking anywhere in your chosen photo. 
Next, you will be able to left-click any other part of the photo to compare the base color and that color. 
Each comparison will provide you with the % of difference and similarity between the two colors.
